# Bonus Content

In this week's folder I have placed a few old projects I have done with GSAP, and some of thier plugins. If you look hard enough through the source code, you might find some GSAP plugin libraries you can link to if you need to use them. Just make sure you realize these plugins were purchased quite a few years ago, so you will have to look at the GSAP docs for the correct version number.

There is also an example using an older version of the JS library MixItUp. This library uses class names as tags to filter/sort your content.

Whats with all the `$`? Ten years ago, when i did a lot of work for ITP as a resident, J-Query was still in style. All J-Query is, is a library on top of vanilla js to make selecting elements and calling common functions a bit more streamlined. If you look at my examples, look at the logic, not the `$`!

## GSAP CDN LINKS FOR PLUGINS
If you are having a hard time finding the CDN script for a GSAP plugin, heres a good place to start looking. Make sure your plugin version matches your GSAP version
