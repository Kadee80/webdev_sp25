# Google Maps API

This demo is pretty straightforward. Today we will take Week10's geolocation example and combine it with Google Maps simple marker example. We will use the computers location to center the map and place a marker in the users current location.

The setup will require a few steps on your own. First, you need to join google developers platform, create a project, and enable the Maps API. They may ask for CC info. Don't worry, we wont be using any paid services, but remember your CC is linked! So publishing your API key on GitHub is like publishing your CC number!

Once you are signed in, create a project. Then enable the Maps API.

Once you have a project with Maps API enabled, you should get a popup with your API KEY. Copy and paste it somewhere safe like your notepad.

In order to use the new Advanced Marker features, we need a Map ID.

Make sure you also copy and paste your Map ID into your notepad, or whereever you are keeping a safe copy of your API key.

Take a few minutes to get everything set up. For a good base reference, here is the [Maps Documentation Dashboard](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript).
