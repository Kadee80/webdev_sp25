# May 1: Final presentations

This Thursday you will be presenting your final project. In order for your final to be considered "on time" you will need to present when your name is called. The student list will be shuffled at the beginning of class and posted below.

**Be sure to:**

- Demo your entire site, show us both desktop and mobile versions. You are required to have at least one media query for mobile in your site.
- Take us through a code snippet of something cool you learned, or figured out. Teach the class something they might not know!
- What would you do if you had more time?
- Code is due on May 8, that's an extra week to fix anything up that might be bothering you, or add a new feature that you just didnt have enough time to implement.
- If you add anything considerable to your code (like a new feature, component, or make a drastic change to how your site looks) be sure to email me when you submit your final code so that I am sure to look for those updates.

### PSA:

Laptops closed once presentations begin. Please be sure to work out any dongle or display mirroring issues ahead of time. The classroom is free during lunchtime hours, all you need to do is plug in and make sure you are set come presentation time!

_IF we manage to get through all 18 presentations in one day, you get next Tuesday free to worry about your other finals!!!_
